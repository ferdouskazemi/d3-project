        <h3>Arc Diagram
        </h3>
        <p>This diagram places nodes in a horizontal or vertical line, with circular arcs for links. Unlike other network visualizations such as a [force layout](/@d3/force-directed-graph), the appearance (and usefulness) of an arc diagram is highly dependent on the order of nodes. Hover over a node below to inspect its connections.</p>
