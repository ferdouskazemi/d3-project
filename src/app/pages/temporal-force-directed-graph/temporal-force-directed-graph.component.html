        <h3>Scatterplot Tour</h3>
        <p>
            This notebook implements an animated tour of a scatterplot using zoom transitions. The tour zooms in on each clusterâ€™s bounding box in succession before zooming back out to the overview. To improve rendering performance, the circles are drawn as zero-length strokes with round caps.
